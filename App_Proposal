Goals-
 The goal of CleanEarth is to encourage people and communities to participate in joint clean up drives within our sorroundings.
 the application will create a platform for people to join efforts in cleaning up parks, streets and other areas.
 These actions encourage responsibilities and collective movements toward SDGs, specifically (Climate Action)
and (Life on Land).

Roles-
As a mobile/web app developer, the project involves designing and
 developing an application that helps users organize, participate in, and 
 track community clean-up events. The app should provide users with a simple
  yet effective way to plan and execute local clean-up initiatives.

Audience-
* Community members interested in environmental sustainability.
* Local government organizations looking to coordinate urban clean-up events.
* Volunteers who want to contribute to environmental causes.
* Environmental activists and NGOs focused on sustainability.
* Schools and colleges looking for community outreach programs.

Situation-
So much of the pollution and littering has resulted in environmental 
degradation not only in most urban areas but also in a large number of rural areas. 
Most clean-up initiatives are scattered, unorganized, and mostly uncoordinated.
 CleanEarth provides an easier-to-use and supportive platform with which to
effect collective action or promote responsible environmentally friendly 
practices that benefit people in their communities.

Objective-
* Promote environmental awareness and responsibility among users.
* Organize and monitor local clean-up events.
* Enable users to directly contribute to reducing waste and improving their local environments.
* Provide an opportunity for the users to share their clean-up experiences, monitor progress, and
 celebrate collective success.

Key SDG Targeted-
SDG 13: Climate Action: CleanEarth directly contributes to mitigating climate change by 
promoting the reduction of waste and pollution, helping improve urban areas and reducing the carbon footprint.

SDG 15: Life on Land: The app will help preserve land ecosystems by encouraging users 
to clean natural habitats and urban spaces, ensuring a healthier environment for both wildlife and communities.

Key Features- 
* Event Creation & Management: Users can create and manage clean-up events.
* Volunteer Sign-Up: Participants can sign up for specific clean-up tasks based on their availability and interests.
* Leaderboard: Encourages healthy competition by displaying top-performing volunteers or communities.
* Resource Library: Provides tips on how to handle waste, organize events, and adopt sustainable practices.
